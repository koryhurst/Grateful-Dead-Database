Finally back.  There are a bunch of errors in the eventual output.  I am not sure if 
it is the initial parsing of the data, or the queries, but my next step is to sort that out.

New baseline repository.  There used to be some sensitive data in it.  Now I have protected it.

I had several weeks of revisions, but the repository got corrupted somehow.
Anyway, here we are now.  There are still some database modifications that I 
want to make.  As well the Database stuff needs to be cleaned up a bit.
It is in pretty good shape though.  Lots of more pages to be built though.

My Dead Playground

I had several weeks of revisions, but the repository got corrupted somehow.
Anyway, here we are now.  There are still some database modifications that I 
want to make.  As well the Database stuff needs to be cleaned up a bit.
It is in pretty good shape though.  Lots of more pages to be built though.

New baseline repository.  There used to be some sensitive data in it.  Now I have protected it.
